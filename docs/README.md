#####HowCrowded is an app for people who want to know crowded places are before they have to make the effort to travel there. This is applicable for everyone from restaurant and bar-goers to neurotic students looking for a carrel in Huntsman or empty desk in Van Pelt.

#####What problem does it solve?
You want to go somewhere, but only if it’s not too crowded (bars, stores, restaurants, study space etc.) Finding out beforehand saves the time of travelling there and having a bad time

#####What similar projects exist?
Visor is similar, and Density takes a less crowd-sourced approach

#####What type of project is it?
Business idea that uses crowdsourcing

#####Who will be the members of your crowd?
Everyday people with smartphones who go places

#####How will you incentivize them to participate?
In order to ask for information about a certain place, you’ll need to answer other people’s questions or provide information proactively

#####What will they provide, and what sort of skills do they need?
People will provide pictures / descriptions / ratings of how crowded places are, how long lines are, how long it would take to order something/get in, etc. The only skills needed are the ability to type in English and take a picture, skills which most smartphone users should have

#####How will you ensure the quality of the crowd provides?
Users can upvote or downvote information, which will affect the user’s score. A really low score could get you banned from contributing / users will know when you send them stuff that it might not be accurate based on your reputation

#####How will you aggregate the results from the crowd?
We could either have a map or just a searchable list of locations with the information sorted into the correct places

#####Describe each of the steps involved in your process. What parts will be done by the crowd, and what parts will be done automatically.
All the crowd does is submit info to others and ask for info from others. They’ll also rate the quality of others’ information (“Was this helpful?”) We would sort the info into the place chosen and display the info for others to see. 
How will you evaluate if your project is successful?

#####What potential problems do you foresee when implementing your project?
There’s a lot of overhead to making an app and getting all the smaller pieces working. It would also be hard to get a sizable user base to contribute data, but we could definitely at least build the platform
